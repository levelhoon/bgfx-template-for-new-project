# What is it?
> This is BGFX template for Visual Studio develop.  
> I've created a template for Visual Studio in case you need to create a task in a new project.  
>Now you can quickly and easily just copy and paste templates, to create and work BGFX-based  new projects.  
> This is because the old method was considered cumbersome to create or work for a new project.
